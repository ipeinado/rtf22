Raising the Floor is an international organization committed to the advancement of social equity through digital inclusion. In our research, design and development work we consider the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age, and other forms of human difference.

## Global multi-disciplinary team
Our work is possible thanks to a global community of developers, designers, researchers, advocates, companies, universities and organizations, in particular, the teams from the [Inclusive Design Research Center](https://idrc.ocadu.ca/) (IDRC) at OCAD University in Canada, and the [Trace R&D Center](https://trace.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland in the United States, to proactively ensure that emerging technology and practices are designed inclusively.

Integrating inclusive design and solutions not only benefits those for whom these efforts were originally designed for, but often has a greater impact on society as well.

## Contribution to Standards
We support open standards, open access, and open source technology wherever possible in order to maximize distribution and to encourage broad participation.

Our experts are also participating in a wide range of standardisation processes in Canadian, American and European standardisation bodies, contributing to make the world a more inclusive place to live.

## Our community

The community working with Raising the Floor has grown to over 300 individuals and over 50 companies, universities and organizations. It includes people and organizations of all points of view and interests: consumers, developers, researchers, practitioners, policy people, vendors, and manufacturers of mainstream and assistive technology. They hail from all parts of the world including every continent except Antarctica.
