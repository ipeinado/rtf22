title: What We Do
---
Raising the Floor partners with collaborative, multi-sector and applied research organizations and networks that proactively prevent barriers and promote greater inclusion. We facilitate adopting an open and collaborative inclusive approach to help design, develop, and promote resources and products that contribute to advance digital equality, enhancing people's quality of life.

## Key activities and services
* **Inclusive Personal Guide**. Someone from our team is paired-up with a company or organization to help identify opportunities to make all digital experiences more inclusive.
* **Education and Training**. We share our inclusive approach methods and tools with individuals and organizations, so diversity can be integrated into all digital solutions.
* **Research and Development**.  We are passionate about designing and developing new solutions to allow for greater inclusion of individuals left behind from full participation in the Digital Age. We use open and participatory methods and practices, and involve the relevant communities and experts in the process. 
* **Tools and Frameworks**. We are always collecting, sharing, designing and developing components and systems that support inclusive design.
* **Exploration**. We explore and test other ways to ensure digital inclusion for all.
* **Standards**. We work with many standardisation groups around the world to ensure that accessibility and overall digital inclusion is considered. 

## Research interests
Raising the Floor's team specializes and is interested in all work related to social equity and digital inclusion. In particular, but not limited to:

* Building accessible coding environments.
* Building flexible software with museums and cultural institutions to enhance their visitors' experience, making it easy for visitors to connect with content, interact with objects, and extend the museum visit. 
* Building interactive gentle sensory environments for a care home, school, or public space.
* Building playful software to encourage learning, growth, and exploration, especially among individuals with intellectual disabilities and developmental delays.
* Building projects/software that empower the collaboration, learning and growth opportunities of people/communities that, for some reason, are or may be at risk of being left behind.
* Building tools and curricula for STEM training among underserved communities.
* Community-driven projects to address the inherent bias against small minorities and outliers in artificial intelligence and data analytics.
* Creating data architectures that help marginalised and under-resourced communities express ownership and control over data which represents them.
* Creating tools that let people with disabilities themselves produce and adapt their own software tools, opening up access to design for all kinds of marginalized communities, with differing accessibility needs. 
* Creating digital tools that promote emotional health and overall quality of life, especially to combat loneliness and isolation due to age or under pandemic-related social measures or other causes.
* Designing educational coding tools for kids who have been left out of learning—especially those with complex needs
* Ensuring access to the tools and an ecosystem that support people with disabilities on a daily basis, and make their lives easier in many ways.
* Ensuring that inclusive solutions are pleasing beyond functional, by using emotion-centered design methods, to impact on people's feelings, emotions and perceptions.
* Ensuring that every device/interface is accessible and able to be used by everyone.
* Exploring machine learning and deep learning techniques in order to automatically build accessible UIs.
* Promoting the tools and ecosystems that support people with disabilities on a daily basis, making their lives easier and better, in all contexts and moments.
